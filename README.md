# Getting Started

This is a [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project to build an interactive and user-friendly website for Nha Khoa My Duc Dental Clinic, powered by [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

## Run the development server

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Run the development server
This project uses AWS Amplify production and dev branches:
- Production: https://nhakhoamyduc.vn/
- Dev: https://deployment.d1oa3aicm14zeg.amplifyapp.com/

There is a workflow to automatically build a new preview website for the new PR to the deployment branch, and delete it after the PR is closed.
